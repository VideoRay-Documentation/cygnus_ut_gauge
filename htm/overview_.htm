<p>The Cygnus Ultrasonic Thickness Gauge allows non-destructive measurements of material thickness.  There are several levels of integration the gauge on VideoRays.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>PAM Integration with Swing Arm</b> - the Swing Arm allows the gauge to be articulated continuously from vertical overhead (for ceiling measurements), through horizontal (for walls), to vertical below (for floors).  The swing arm can also be positioned to take measurements from inclined surfaces.  PAM integration allows for video overlay of the thickness measurements.</a><p></p></li>

  <li><b>PAM Integration with Standard Mount</b> - PAM integration allows the communications to use the ROV communications bus.  This means that the APIC is free for use by other devices, and the thickness measurements can be integrated with VideoRay Cockpit and displayed on the ROV video using the video overlay.  The mount is the same as the Standard integration.<p></p></li>

  <li><b>Standard Mount</b> - in this mode, the gauge is mounted on a gimbal and communications is over the VideoRay Pro 4 APIC <a href="../../pro_4/html/acc_overview.html" target="_blank"><img src="../../required/images/icon_manual.png" title="VideoRay Pro 4 APIC"></a>, or spare pair.  The gimbal mount is fixed in one orientation (vertical or horizontal), and there is no integration of the operation with VideoRay Cockpit.<p></p></li>
  </ul>
