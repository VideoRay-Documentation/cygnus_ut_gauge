<p>The Cygnus Ultrasonic Thickness Gauge allows non-destructive measurements of material thickness. There are several levels of integration for the gauge on VideoRay ROVs.</p>

<ul>
  
  <li><b>PAM Integration with Swing Arm</b> - the Swing Arm allows the gauge to be articulated continuously from a vertical overhead (for ceiling measurements) position, through horizontal (for walls), to vertical below (for floors). The swing arm can also be positioned to take measurements from inclined surfaces. PAM integration allows for video overlay of the thickness measurements.</a><p></p></li>

  <li><b>PAM Integration with Standard Mount</b> - PAM integration allows the device to use the VideoRay communications bus. This means that the APIC is free to be used by other devices, and the thickness measurements can be integrated with VideoRay Cockpit and displayed on the ROV video using the video overlay. The mount is the same as the Standard integration.<p></p></li>

  <li><b>Standard Mount</b> - in this configuration, the gauge is mounted on a gimbal and communications are conveyed over the VideoRay Pro 4 APIC or spare pair. The gimbal mount is fixed in one orientation (vertical or horizontal), and there is no integration of the operating process including VideoRay Cockpit.<p></p></li>
  </ul>
